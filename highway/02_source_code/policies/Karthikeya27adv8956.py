"""HighwayEnv Karthikeya27adv8956 DQN with retained safety evidence.

Author: Sai Durga Karthik Nandiraju

Training policy
---------------
* Policy name: Karthikeya27adv8956.
* The baseline-compatible DQN/environment settings, 80/20 training split, and
  frozen greedy testing remain unchanged. Scheduled exploration is one initial
  pass followed by one UNKNOWN-only pass.
* Per-action clean, collision, and out-of-road counts support evidence-aware
  UNKNOWN, SAFE, and BLOCKED masks. SAFE requires two clean observations by
  default; one collision or out-of-road observation immediately blocks.
* Candidates with blocked evidence are evicted after ordinary candidates and
  their evidence is retained in a bounded lookup-only HAZARD archive. A later
  matching state uses that evidence without changing pool capacity or the
  candidate/promotion lifecycle.
* Candidate, active, retired, and hazard selection excludes BLOCKED actions
  while any SAFE or UNKNOWN action remains. During mutable training, a matching
  local record permanently inherits a hazard record's blocked evidence. If all
  nine actions are blocked, the action with the fewest recorded collision plus
  out-of-road failures is executed; fresh DQN Q breaks equal-risk ties.
* An ACTIVE pool tries every eligible action once, retries each still-UNKNOWN
  non-BLOCKED action once, and retires only after the final delayed outcome.
* After the initial pass, a RETIRED pool uses deterministic seeded
  epsilon-greedy selection: 80% chooses the highest-Q eligible action across
  SAFE and UNKNOWN, and 20% uniformly explores UNKNOWN only. If no UNKNOWN
  action remains, the random branch falls back to the highest-Q eligible action.
  If all actions are BLOCKED, it executes the least-dangerous BLOCKED action.
* Collision and out-of-road penalties both default to 50, giving the DQN equal
  configured penalty magnitude for both safety failures.
* A single canonical record collection uses CANDIDATE, ACTIVE, RETIRED, and
  lookup-only HAZARD status tags. Promotion and retirement preserve the record
  ID and centroid.
* Combined active+retired capacity is fixed at 500 by default. Capacity
  reviews therefore cannot grow the permanent pool beyond that limit.
* Candidate reception uses the Basic Optimal limits: 125 soft, 150 hard, and
  bounded batch eviction of 25 by default.
* The DQN receives the complete flattened HighwayEnv Kinematics observation.
* Pool matching requires both general-state similarity and safety similarity.
* The safety vector contains pre-action lane-boundary clearance, nearest collision-hazard
  centre distance, absolute lane offset, absolute heading error, and ego speed
  in km/h.
* Missing or non-finite safety information is never replaced with optimistic
  values. That state skips pool lookup/evidence and uses fresh DQN argmax.
* After an initial pure-DQN learning period, general and safety normalizers/
  calibrators are fitted on training only and frozen. General gates are learned
  from evidence; safety calibration is conservatively bounded at cosine 0.98
  and RMS 0.10. Candidate RMS gates may tighten but never exceed 0.25.
* Every policy-phase state checks safety-strict HAZARD matching and the local lookup
  order ACTIVE, RETIRED, then CANDIDATE. A local candidate is created only when
  no local record matches; a hazard match can filter that candidate's action.
* A candidate is promoted after four visits by default, matching the previous
  Karthikeya27 policy.
* Pool behavior starts only after the pure-DQN, normalization, and threshold-
  calibration warm-up is complete, and remains active until the configured
  pool-training boundary (80% of training by default).
* Candidate centroids freeze after two consecutive stable updates or four
  updates. Active-pool centroids freeze after three consecutive stable updates
  or ten updates by default, matching Basic Optimal.
* During the final 20% of training, pool evidence and lifecycle mutations are
  frozen and action selection is pure DQN argmax across all nine actions. Pool
  lookup, safety extraction, and safety masks are not used. No visits, masks,
  candidates, centroids, promotion, retirement, eviction, calibration, or
  capacity review is updated.
* Candidate visits 1 through promotion-1 record the genuinely executed
  actions. Candidate-created, candidate-matched, and capacity-waiting steps
  use fresh DQN ranking, skip blocked actions, and otherwise use argmax.
* On the promotion visit, the candidate becomes permanent before action
  selection; previously executed candidate actions are removed from the
  new mask, then the highest-Q remaining action is selected and removed.
* At the fixed 500-pool limit, no further permanent pools or unmatched-state
  candidates are created. Matching hazard evidence still filters actions;
  otherwise deterministic DQN argmax is used.
* Every record tracks 9-bit unknown, safe, and blocked outcome masks plus
  per-action evidence counts. No DQN Q-values or rankings are stored.
* A clean action counts toward SAFE only when its immediate environment reward
  is at least 0.01; safe-but-stationary actions remain UNKNOWN.
* An ACTIVE record reuses one 9-bit action-availability mask for INITIAL and
  UNKNOWN passes. Refill and selected-bit removal are O(1).
* The selected action bit is cleared in O(1).
* An empty initial-pass mask is refilled once from UNKNOWN excluding BLOCKED.
  Final retirement waits for the last UNKNOWN action's five-step result.
* RETIRED means scheduled coverage is finished, not that learning is closed.
  Direct retired matches and mature candidates continue updating
  UNKNOWN/SAFE/BLOCKED evidence, while the availability mask stays empty.
* Normal matching first applies all four strict gates, then permits only a 2%
  general cosine/RMS relaxation with both general and both strict safety gates
  required. A close-enough
  ACTIVE/RETIRED lookup is reserved for candidate hard-limit pressure,
  permanent-capacity pressure, and eviction. It allows a 2% lower
  general-cosine threshold and a 10% higher general-RMS threshold, with both
  relaxed general gates required. Both safety gates remain strict, no
  directional safety feature may worsen, and at least one directional safety
  feature must improve by at least 10%.
* When combined active + retired capacity is full, no new pool is created.
* Candidate eviction checks only the selected eviction shortlist against active
  pools using the normal active-pool thresholds. A matching candidate transfers
  centroid, visits, and action history
  into the active pool before deletion. Eviction
  removes old one-visit candidates before old two-visit candidates and never
  evicts three-visit near-promotion records. Recently-created and
  blocked-evidence candidates remain protected when possible. Unavoidably
  evicted blocked evidence enters bounded HAZARD
  memory.
* Every CANDIDATE, ACTIVE, RETIRED, or HAZARD match computes fresh DQN Q-values.
  All safety-policy paths remove BLOCKED actions before ranking or random
  exploration, except the all-BLOCKED least-risk fallback.
* Time-limit truncations end an episode but remain bootstrap-enabled replay
  transitions; only true HighwayEnv termination suppresses the DQN target.
* The all-BLOCKED fallback sends a real action to HighwayEnv, so its resulting
  reward and any collision or off-road outcome are recorded normally.
* Capacity review is disabled during the final pure-DQN training phase.
* Direct final-mask actions retire only after their transitions are observed.
  Candidate-history exhaustion completes the scheduled pass without inventing
  an action outcome.

Complexity
----------
* Active, candidate, retired, and hazard lookup uses exact vectorized matching
  over preallocated recyclable centroid slots.
  This guarantees that the globally best valid cosine/RMS match is selected.
* Empty checks, bit clearing, candidate recycling, promotion, and retirement:
  O(1) average time.
* Outcome-aware action filtering is O(A), effectively O(1) for fixed A=9.
* Matching is O(B(D+S)) on an active hit and O((B+R+C+H)(D+S)) on a miss.
  One capacity-pressure fallback is O((B+R)(D+S)). Candidate eviction is
  O(C log E + E*(B+R)(D+S)), where E is the bounded
  eviction shortlist size. With configured bounded E, eviction is linear in
  candidate and pool storage.
* Match diagnostics and the close-enough pass reuse the same vectorized gate
  arrays. They add only linear work over the current status and O(1) scalar
  counter updates; no nested pool scan is introduced.
* Capacity review uses an O(1) ready-waiter queue and generation cache, checking
  only permanent centroids changed since each waiter's last exact scan.
* Eviction-history diagnostics retain only the most recent 500 rows by default;
  all-time eviction totals and dropped-history counts remain available.
* Plot generation is best-effort and runs only after required data/model files
  are saved, so a plotting error cannot invalidate an otherwise complete run.
* Replay insertion and indexed ring-buffer sampling are O(1) and
  O(batch_size), respectively.
* Representatives use float32 storage by default for threshold-stable benchmark
  behavior. Policy storage is O((B+C+R+H)(D+S+A)), with B + R bounded by
  max-state-pools and H by hazard-memory-capacity.

Shared setup
------------
* Plain DQN, target network, replay buffer, and Adam optimizer.
* Benchmark summaries are collision-focused; raw rewards remain only in the
  episode-level results for auditability.
* No RND and no count-based intrinsic reward.
* The fully trained final model is evaluated once with frozen pure-DQN argmax.
  The canonical ``test`` phase does not use pool matching, safety masks, or an
  engine-object safety scan. Training and saved safety memory are unchanged.
* Disjoint training and testing scenarios.
* Environment traffic configuration matches the canonical baselines.
* Deterministic PyTorch settings match the canonical baselines.
